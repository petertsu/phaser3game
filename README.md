# Phaser 3 Game

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

### Babel

You can write modern ES6+ JavaScript and Babel will transpile it to a version of JavaScript that you
want your project to support. The targeted browsers are set in the `.babelrc` file and the default currently
targets all browsers with total usage over "0.25%" but excludes IE11 and Opera Mini.

```
"browsers": [
  ">0.25%",
  "not ie 11",
  "not op_mini all"
]
```

### Webpack

If you want to customize your build, such as adding a new webpack loader or plugin (i.e. for loading CSS or fonts), you can
modify the `webpack/base.js` file for cross-project changes, or you can modify and/or create
new configuration files and target them in specific npm tasks inside of `package.json'.
